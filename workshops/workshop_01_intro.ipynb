    "\n",
    "These workshops come to accompany the lectures and recitations by taking another dive into the subjects of this course, but from a more \"hands-on\" approach. The purpose of the workshops is to achieve the following goals:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **The primary goal**: Improve the understanding and intuition behind the methods taught in the course by applying them to examples, and discussing the different nuances of each method.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **The secondary goal**: Provide tools for approaching and solving machine learning real problems in real life by using state of the art tools to problem sets which are based on real data."

    "\n",
    "Apart from the first one, the workshops will have the following structure:\n",
    "- A separate background section in which we will introduce the new topics. In class, we will only go through the highlights of this section.\n",
    "- The main example section in which we will apply our tools to a given problem. We will usually do it in an iterative way of trial and error. This section will be accompanied by the code for the solution of the problem. In class, we will not dive into the code but only give a general overview of what it does. \n",
    "- Some of the workshops will conclude with a theoretical section in which we will discuss and solve some more theoretical questions usually unrelated to the problem from the previous section.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Relation to Homework Assignment\n",
    "The hands-on part (\"wet\" part) of the homework assignment will be of the same form of implementation section of the workshops.\n",
    "\n",
    "### A comment about the code\n",
    "In many cases, the code or the algorithm in these workshops is not written in very efficient, since we have preferred to keep the code readable and to keep it as close as possible to the algorithm described in class. In almost all cases, there already exist packages implementing these algorithms, we have tried to give references to these implementations whenever they exist."

    "- It is currently one of the most popular programming languages. (It is the 3rd most popular language, after C and Java, [according to this survey](https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/))\n",
    "- Almost all new frameworks in the field of machine learning are developed for python: PyTorch, TensorFlow, Keras, etc.\n",
    "- It is a very powerful programing language and yet very simple to learn and to get started with. ([See what XKCD has to say about it](https://xkcd.com/353/))\n",
    "- It's open-source (=> free) with a huge community behind it.\n",
    "- It has a ridiculously rich set of packages for almost any task. From basic mathematical tools([basic numeric](http://www.numpy.org/), [advance numerics](https://www.scipy.org/scipylib/index.html), [symbolic math](https://www.sympy.org) [data handling](https://pandas.pydata.org/), [visualizing](https://mode.com/blog/python-data-visualization-libraries), etc.), through a range of advanced frameworks for [deep learning](https://www.kdnuggets.com/2017/02/python-deep-learning-frameworks-overview.html), [distributed computing](https://wiki.python.org/moin/ParallelProcessing), [web servers](https://www.djangoproject.com/), etc. and up to stuff such as a complete framework for writing [simple games](https://www.pygame.org)"
