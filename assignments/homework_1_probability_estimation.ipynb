When it comes to plotting graphs python is still behind the curve in comparison to some other programming languages such as Matlab, R and JavaScript especially when it comes to the interactivity of the figure and the ability to edit it. In recent years, [a lot of new promising alternatives](https://mode.com/blog/python-data-visualization-libraries) started to appear, but matplotlib is still the most versatile and the easiest tool to start with.
